**Alumni Data and Engagement Tracking System**

_The Master of Information Management (MIM) program needs a system to collect 
contact information from alumni along with their areas of interest in volunteering. These 
areas of interest include mentoring, mock interviews, alumni panels and resume review 
sessions. In addition to providing functionality for the alumni to submit this information, 
it will also require a web front-end for the faculty to query information on the alumni 
interest areas and contact information._
